My approach to designing software is methodical and organized. The software requirements provided by the client serve as a framework and starting point. Then, utilizing either pseudocode or flowcharts, the program can be planned and separated into classes, methods, objects, iterations, etc. From there, it is simply a one step at a time process with debugging and testing along the way. Clear and concise expectations are critical to a high-quality, functional program that behaves entirely as expected. In addition, formal testing of the program is essential. The testing phase of software development should be as thorough and organized as the design phase. Effective tests in addition to sufficient statement, decision, and code coverage are crucial to the success of a program. With a commitment to quality and organization maintained throughout the process, success is inevitable.
